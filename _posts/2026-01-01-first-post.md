I created **a** to document my journey into cybersecurity.

This blog is not about perfection.
It’s about **learning in public**, building skills, and tracking progress.

Topics I’ll write about:
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Labs and experiments
- Tools I’m learning
- Personal reflections

This is the first log.
